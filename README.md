🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Multivariate time series modeling

Trend & seasonality simulation

Stationarity testing (ADF test)

Sequence-to-sequence LSTM forecasting

Bayesian optimization (Optuna)

Explainable AI (Integrated Gradients)

📊 Dataset Description

A synthetic multivariate time series dataset is programmatically generated to mimic real-world behavior.

Dataset Characteristics

3 correlated time series

Clear trend

Multiple seasonal patterns

Random noise

500 time steps

Each series acts as an independent feature, and the forecasting target is derived from the first feature.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Steps Performed

Stationarity Check
Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test is applied to each feature.

Scaling
Min-Max scaling is used to normalize feature ranges.

Sequence Creation

Lookback window: 30 time steps

Forecast horizon: 2 steps ahead

This converts the dataset into supervised learning format suitable for LSTM models.

🏗️ Model Architecture

The forecasting model is an LSTM-based deep neural network.

Architecture Highlights

1–3 stacked LSTM layers (tuned)

Tunable number of hidden units

Dropout regularization

Dense output layer for multi-step forecasting

The architecture is dynamically configured during hyperparameter optimization.

🔍 Hyperparameter Optimization

Optuna is used to perform Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

Tuned Parameters

Number of LSTM layers

Number of hidden units

Objective

Minimize Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the validation set.

This approach efficiently explores the search space and identifies the best-performing model configuration.

📏 Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Penalizes large prediction errors

Common metric for regression tasks

MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)

Scale-independent

Compared against a naive forecast

Values below 1 indicate better-than-naive performance

🔍 Model Explainability

To interpret the deep learning model’s predictions, Integrated Gradients is applied.

Explainability Goals

Identify which input features contribute most to predictions

Aggregate importance across time steps

Improve transparency of sequence-based predictions

Approach

Zero baseline is used

Gradients are computed across interpolated inputs

Feature importance is visualized using bar charts

This step ensures the model is not a black box.

📈 Results & Observations

Optimized LSTM significantly outperforms naive forecasting

Bayesian optimization leads to faster convergence and improved accuracy

Integrated Gradients reveal dominant contributing features

Multi-step forecasting captures temporal dependencies effectively
